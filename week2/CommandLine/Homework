1. Research how to create a hidden file and how to display it using ls command.
$ touch file.txt  (Create File)
$ ls -a  (List all file)

2. Research how to create multiple nested directories with one mkdir command.
E.g. How would you create 'fun' directory along with all directories in the path below:
/c/Users/unmesh/these/folders/are/just/for/fun

$ cd 
$ pwd 
$ cd c:
$ mkdir -p these/{folders,are,just,for,fun}

3. Execute following commands terminal:
echo "test" > fun
echo "another test" >> fun
wc -c fun

Answer "18 fun" . It means 18 character. I think system count spaces.

4. Research how to append something in the file *WITHOUT* a newline character.
E.g.
echo "test" > fun
echo "another test" >> fun
cat fun
Output of "cat fun" is
test
another test

How would you use echo command, so that output would be:
testanother test

Answer 

$ echo -n "test" >>fun
$ echo - e "test1 >>fun
$ cat fun
Result  :  testtest1
